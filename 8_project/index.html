        <p>
            International trade gives rise to a world economy,<br>
            in which supply and demand, and therefore prices, <br>
            both affect and are affected by global events. <br>Political 
            change in Asia, for example, could result in an increase <br>
            in the cost of labor, thereby increasing the manufacturing <br>
            costs for an American sneaker company based in Malaysia, <br>
            which would then result in an increase in the price charged <br>
            at your local mall. </p>

                at your local mall. A decrease in the cost of labor, on the <br>

                for your new shoes.</p>
