            International trade gives rise to a world economy,
            in which supply and demand, and therefore prices,
            both affect and are affected by global events. Political 
            change in Asia, for example, could result in an increase 
            in the cost of labor, thereby increasing the manufacturing
            costs for an American sneaker company based in Malaysia, 
            which would then result in an increase in the price charged 
            at your local mall. </p>

            <p>International trade gives rise to a world economy,<br>
                in which supply and demand, and therefore prices, <br>
                both affect and are affected by global events. <br>Political 
                change in Asia, for example, could result in an increase <br>
                in the cost of labor, thereby increasing the manufacturing <br>
                costs for an American sneaker company based in Malaysia, <br>
                which would then result in an increase in the price charged <br>
                at your local mall. A decrease in the cost of labor, on the <br>
                other hand, would likely result in you having to pay less <br>
                for your new shoes.</p>
